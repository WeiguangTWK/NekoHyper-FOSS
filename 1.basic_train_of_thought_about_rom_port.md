> As I decided to keep this parts as secret before NekoHyper gain popularity before, now I realized that this kind of "close source" idea actually against what I advocate: "**Open, Trust, Secure**". And also I don't think person who can reach here will do something violating the Opensource Licence or even completely ruin the rom community  (e.g. some **** from c*****k). So I will write about the basic train of thought how I made a rom here.

### Before we begin

Before we begin let me introduce a conception named "**Baseline version**"

When Xiaomi hasn't stopped the publish of DEV version, new update of stable version will merge some changeset from DEV, meaning each Stable build **corresponds** a DEV build

Take NHS 1.0.24.28.DEV for example, it is based on 1.0.5.UMRCNXM. And the baseline version of 1.0.5 is 1.0.24.8.DEV. So to port 1.0.24.28 to marble just find what have changed from 1.0.24.8 to 1.0.24.28 and merge them into 1.0.5

The advantage of the method above is stable (no much bugs). But on the other hand it highly depends on the baseline version. If wrong one is choosen, the result can be catastrophic. Especially now the DEV build stopped release, making it even harder to use when marble stable get updated.

### The part decoupled from hardware

Different from some roms, I just port "software" part of the new version to marble instead of copy the whole GSI partitions(mi_ext, product, system, system_ext). Typically updates in DEV build only changes the software part, the part that has strong relation to hardware usually won't change much (see [VNDK docs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/vndk/snapshot-design) and [Android Structure](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture) from Google).

Now porting from "software part" is proved by time to be a stable way to port new rom, but maybe soon deprecated as the stop of DEV build
