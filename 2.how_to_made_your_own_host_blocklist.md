### About hosts

hosts located at /system/etc/hosts can help you redirect domain to certain IP address. So we can block certain domain using hosts like


```
0.0.0.0 adv.sec.miui.com
```
 
### How to get URL to block

You can use packet capture like [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) on PC or [PCAPdroid](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid) on your device and test it with [Virtual-hosts](https://github.com/x-falcon/Virtual-Hosts)

I personally recommand PCAPdroid since you can choose app to capture packet.

Also here is the host integrated in NHS


```
0.0.0.0 adv.sec.miui.com
0.0.0.0 adv.sec.intl.miui.com
0.0.0.0 analytics.miui.com
0.0.0.0 analytics.db.miui.com
0.0.0.0 gamebox.sec.miui.com
0.0.0.0 api.developer.xiaomi.com
0.0.0.0 api.tw06.xlmc.sec.miui.com
0.0.0.0 jupiter.sys.miui.com
0.0.0.0 api.ad.xiaomi.com
0.0.0.0 staging.mcc.inf.miui.com
0.0.0.0 mcc.inf.miui.com
```

I also recommand hosts from [ksant0s](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ksant0s/89029bb31fa74a1b6aa7a961d19bc367/raw/e2f935c6ce75982d82312b29d6675c6c96b23bdd/hosts) which block almost all Xiaomi stuff and suitable for user who don't use Xiaomi services
